City is divided into layers, progressing underground into a vast bazaar of ancient memories and strange new inventions.

The top side (the Stage) is a sprawling metropolis of poverty and neglect. The only building kept in good repairs is the entrance to the lower levels, it also serves as the forum for the leadership council. 

The first level down is a marketplace, with hawkers and merchants and wares from above, below, and beyond the boarders of Maya. Stalls line the streets, along with even smaller shops selling their wares from woven rugs or reed mats. Theft is common, but law is applied swiftly and harshly to those caught.

The Second level is separated into rough quarters, each belonging to a major house - house Amaui, house Ysha, house M'qo, and house Caana. The houses are a loose collection of craftsmen and artificers working in similar fields.
