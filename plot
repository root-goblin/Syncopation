Does faith matter?

Faith is something andy doesn't believe in. To have faith in a video game turns two consequences into four reactions. Faith is the illogical belief in something - an idea turned into... fuel.

From the perspective of a God, faith is existance, from the perspective of a human, faith is extravagance.

The player will be putting their faith in a macguffin. (possibly literally a chekov's gun). Everyone has a macguffin - "this thing will save me!". Peoples will have different levels of faith in their macguffin.

City in a state of disrepair - slowly declining over millenia. Ancient magitech. Poor citizens abound, urchins wander the streets.

Stealth mechanics - MGS on the game boy. Tomb raider-ish. 

Quests - get item X for person Y, or go to place Y to do X.

For retrival quests, choices can involve sneaky retrieval or conversational retreival - basically choices on how to retrieve macguffin.

The player's choices do not matter unless they forcibly change the game.

Loss of choice is a consequence of failure - as in the more the players fail, the less choices they'll be able to make.

Ancient evil sit underneath the city!



Plot:

player begins as a glory seeking adventurer, headed to the city of maya in search of something

player meets



fin: player is led to the truth -> they are the source of the macguffin's power since they in fact play the game.
