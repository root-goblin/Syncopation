About how to incorporate the story changing thing
[12:49:12 AM] Not Dan: honestly, I was expecting you to be asleep
[12:49:14 AM] Not Dan: But yeah
[12:49:30 AM] Not Dan: So you said you wanted a puzzle type game
[12:49:50 AM] Not Dan: So what if a significant mechanic was impersonal defense system things
[12:49:54 AM] Not Dan: like automatons
[12:50:06 AM] Not Dan: And those automatons would go and preform some sequence of events
[12:50:13 AM] Not Dan: like a patrol, but more complex.
[12:50:51 AM] Not Dan: So then one of the ways of bypassing that would be to find whatever terminal controls them and to change their patrol schedule
[12:50:57 AM] Not Dan: change their story board so to say.
[12:51:33 AM] Not Dan: But then, at the end of the game, you can present an awkwardly placed terminal at the end of the last temple/dungeon/whatever
[12:51:42 AM] Not Dan: and It's the same interface with the story board stuff
[12:52:07 AM] Not Dan: Except then it's the storyboard of the game
[12:53:04 AM] Not Dan: Similarly, you could probably do a spatial thing to compliment the time thing
[12:54:00 AM] Not Dan: Like on the gameplay level you can change the layout of some levels a bit to help avoid aggro
[12:55:59 AM] Not Dan: But then on the macro level, at the end of the game, you can change the layout of the city, or maybe significantly alter some area of the city.
[1:02:13 AM] Not Dan: And then your game becomes so meta Douglas Hofstadter just annihilates his pants.
[1:03:34 AM] Not Dan: Bonus points if you make the event of finding the master storyboard alterable.
