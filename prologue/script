Act 0, Scene 0: "There's always a man, always a lighthouse, always a city." - Elizabeth


Art:
Heya. <flips coin> Heads or tails, you think?

$ Do I get a choice?

Art:
It's up to you to decide that.

$ You mean the coin? You're the one flipping it.

Art:
Hmm, that's true. I mean I'm flipping the coin, that's the truth of it. To be honest, I just like confusing strangers - that's what Elaine tells me, at least.

$ You are doing a great job ...Who's Elaine?

Art: 
She's nice, who are you?

	case 1:
		I'm looking for someone
	case 2:
		I'm searching for something
	case 3:
		I've lost something
	case 4:
		I'm lost
}

Art:
You should probably go see Elaine, she likes to help out. She might help you out of that predicament.

$ Huh. Where might I find her dd
